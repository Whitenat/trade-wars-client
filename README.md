It's oh so quiet
Shh shh
It's oh so still
Shh shh
You're all alone
Shh shh


Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair

New man on the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay

Shh shh
Starts another big riot
You blow a fuse
Zing boom
The devil cuts loose
Zing boom
So what's the use
Wow bam
Of falling in love
It's oh so quiet
It's oh so still
You're all alone
And so peaceful until
