It's oh so quiet
Shh shh
It's oh so still
Shh shh

You're all alone
Shh shh
And so peaceful until
You fall in love
Zing boom
The sky up above
Zing boom
Is caving in
Wow bam

You've never been so nuts about a guy
You want to laugh you want to cry
You cross your heart and hope to die
'Til it's over and then
Shh shh
It's nice and quiet
Shh shh
But soon again
Shh shh

Starts another big riot
You blow a fuse
Zing boom
The devil cuts loose
Zing boom
So what's the use
Wow bam
Of falling in love
It's oh so quiet
It's oh so still
You're all alone
And so peaceful until


I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% THAT BITCH
