It's oh so quiet
Shh shh
It's oh so still
Shh shh

You're all alone
Shh shh


Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New man on the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay


And so peaceful until
You fall in love
Zing boom
The sky up above
Zing boom
Is caving in
Wow bam

You've never been so nuts about a guy
You want to laugh you want to cry
You cross your heart and hope to die
'Til it's over and then
Shh shh
It's nice and quiet
Shh shh
But soon again
Shh shh

Starts another big riot
You blow a fuse
Zing boom
The devil cuts loose
Zing boom
So what's the use
Wow bam
Of falling in love
It's oh so quiet
It's oh so still
You're all alone
And so peaceful until

Money's tight, yes it's true
I've got none, but I'll show you
Just how rich, a poor boy can be
So here I am, fingers crossed
Try me out, free of cost
It's my zero interest guarantee
Meet me by the smokestack in Governor Square
And I'll show you what it is I do

She brought the sugar and the mint
She brought the sugar and the mint
And he brought the whiskey
Asked for my blessing
"Yes, sir, I know she'sâ€”"
